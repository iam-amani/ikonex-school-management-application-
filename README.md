## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript | Solid foundation, no build step needed |
| Backend | Node.js + Express.js | JavaScript full-stack, fast to develop |
| Database | MySQL | Relational data, strong constraint support |
| PDF Generation | jsPDF + AutoTable | Client-side, no extra server dependency |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub | Industry standard |
| Deployment | Render (backend + DB) + Netlify (frontend) | Free tier, GitHub integration |

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Connection pool** — reuses DB connections instead of opening a new one per request
- **UNIQUE KEY on scores(student_id, subject_id)** — duplicate score submissions blocked at DB level
- **total_score calculated by API** — avoids MySQL GENERATED column compatibility issues
- **grade_config table** — grading scale is data, not hardcoded logic; editable without code changes
- **ON DELETE CASCADE on scores** — deleting a student removes their scores automatically
- **ON DELETE RESTRICT on students FK** — cannot delete a stream that still has students
- **One shared modal** — all forms share a single modal; content injected dynamically

---

## Functional Requirements Covered

### Class Stream Management
- Create class streams (e.g. Form 1A, Form 1B)
- View all class streams
- View details of a single stream including student count
- Edit stream name
- Delete stream (blocked if students are enrolled)

### Student Management
- Register students and assign to a class stream
- Edit student information
- Delete student (scores deleted automatically via CASCADE)
- View a single student's details and scores
- View all students
- View students belonging to a specific class stream
- Search students by name or admission number

### Subject Management
- Create and manage subjects with unique codes
- Assign subjects to class streams
- View all subjects
- Edit and delete subject information
- Prevent duplicate subject-stream assignments

### Student Assessment and Scoring
- Record CAT (0–50) and Exam (0–50) scores per student per subject
- Edit and update student scores
- View individual student performance by subject
- View class performance for a selected subject
- Validate score entries (range 0–50)
- Prevent duplicate score submissions (UNIQUE KEY + 409 response)

### Results Processing
- Calculate total marks per student (CAT + Exam)
- Calculate average scores per student
- Determine grades based on configurable grading scale
- Calculate overall class positions
- Rank students within a class stream based on performance

### Reporting
- Generate individual PDF report cards showing:
  - Student details (name, admission number, stream)
  - Scores per subject (CAT, Exam, Total, Grade)
  - Overall total, average, grade, and class position
- Generate PDF class performance reports showing:
  - All students ranked by position
  - Total marks, average, and grade per student

## Database Design

### Entity Relationship Summary

```
streams (1) ──────── (many) students
students (1) ──────── (many) scores
subjects (many) ────── (many) streams  [via stream_subjects]
subjects (1) ──────── (many) scores
scores ──── grade_config [BETWEEN lookup, not FK]
```

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `streams` | Class groups e.g. Form 1A |
| `students` | Student records, linked to one stream |
| `subjects` | School subjects with unique codes |
| `stream_subjects` | Junction table — which subjects belong to which stream |
| `scores` | CAT + Exam marks per student per subject |
| `grade_config` | Configurable grading scale |

### Default Grading Scale

| Grade | Range | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| A | 80 – 100 | Excellent |
| B | 65 – 79 | Good |
| C | 50 – 64 | Average |
| D | 40 – 49 | Below Average |
| E | 0 – 39 | Fail |

---

## Prerequisites

Install these before starting:

| Tool | Download | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js LTS | https://nodejs.org | Runs the backend |
| Git | https://git-scm.com | Version control |
| VS Code | https://code.visualstudio.com | Code editor |
| Live Server (VS Code extension) | Search in VS Code extensions | Serves the frontend |

Verify installation in terminal:
```bash
node -v       # v18 or higher
npm -v        # 9 or higher
git --version
```

---

## Local Setup

### Step 1 — Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanidy/ikonex-school-management-application-.git
cd ikonex-school-management-application-
```

### Step 2 — Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This installs:
- `express` — web framework
- `mysql2` — MySQL database driver with promise support
- `cors` — allows frontend to call backend across different origins
- `dotenv` — loads environment variables from .env file
- `nodemon` — auto-restarts server on file changes (dev only)

### Step 3 — Create environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then open `.env` and fill in your values. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below.

### Step 4 — Set up the database
Two options:

**Option A — Railway (recommended):**
Go to your Railway project → MySQL plugin → Query tab → paste and run `backend/db/schema.sql`

**Option B — Local MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Then paste the contents of `backend/db/schema.sql`

### Step 5 — Start the backend
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
Server running on port 3000
```

Test it: open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see:
```json
{ "message": "School Management API  running" }
```

### Step 6 — Open the frontend

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT open `index.html` by double-clicking it. ES Modules
are blocked by browsers when loaded from `file://`. You must use a web server.

**Recommended — VS Code Live Server:**
1. Install the **Live Server** extension by Ritwick Dey
2. Right-click `frontend/index.html`
3. Click **Open with Live Server**
4. Browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`

**Alternative — Terminal:**
```bash
cd frontend
npx serve . -p 8080
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080`

---

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` with these values:

```env
# Database connection
MYSQLHOST=your-railway-host
MYSQLPORT=your-railway-port
MYSQLUSER=root
MYSQLPASSWORD=your-railway-password
MYSQL_DATABASE=railway

# Server
PORT=3000
```

For Railway deployment, these are set in the Railway dashboard under
your service's Variables tab.

**Never commit `.env` to GitHub.** It is listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
# Terminal 1 — keep this running
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2 — for git commands and other work
# Open frontend/index.html with Live Server in VS Code
```

### With auto-restart on file changes
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Assumptions Made

The following assumptions were made during development:

1. CAT score is out of 50 and Exam score is out of 50, giving a maximum total of 100
2. Each student belongs to exactly one class stream at a time
3. A subject can be assigned to multiple streams
4. A stream can have multiple subjects
5. Grading scale defaults are seeded into the database but can be edited directly
6. Authentication and login are out of scope for this  version(to be improved according to role base)
7. PDF generation is client-side using jsPDF  a production system would use server-side rendering
8. Duplicate score submissions are blocked at the database level via UNIQUE KEY constraint
9. Deleting a stream is blocked if students are still enrolled in it
10. Deleting a student automatically removes all their scores via ON DELETE CASCADE

---

## Known Limitations

- No authentication or role-based access control
- No pagination on large student lists
- PDF layout may vary across browsers due to client-side rendering
- No automated tests (unit or integration)
- Session state is not persisted  refreshing reloads data from the API
- This project's MySQL database is hosted on Aiven's
  free tier, which automatically powers off after a period of inactivity.

---
## Working On
 - Finding a long-lasting backend hosting solution
 - Improving the whole UI to be more friendly
